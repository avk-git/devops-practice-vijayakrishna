 docker-compose
----------------
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services.
 Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. ... Run docker-compose up and Compose starts and runs your entire app


https://docs.docker.com/samples/wordpress/

we use one command docker-compose up -d

every thing will be done

1st install docker compose on server

https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/



now 

cd /opt

vi docker-compose.yaml


docker-compose up -d

now see docker images
  
docker ps
 

goto google 
ip:8000


now docker-compose down




=====================================================

docker swarm
-----------
Docker Swarm is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers. 
With Swarm, IT administrators and developers can establish and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system.


docker --version

docker network ls


Step4: Now we have to initilize Docker swarm in master Node
https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/


Run the following command to create a new swarm:
$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.0.23

docker network ls

This command will list out how many nodes are available 
docker node ls

docker network ls


Creating service 
docker service create --replicas 6 -p 80:80 --name service1 nginx
docker service ls

If u want to know about the service indetail
docker service ps service1

To Manage load we have a scaling option
docker service scale service1=15

Scale down the services
docker service scale service=5


updating service version
Updating new version:
docker pull nginx:1.14.0
docker service update --image nginx  service1


To know about the service indetail
docker service ps service

If you want to Remove any service
docker service rm service name

docker service rm service1


If you want to leave swarm cluster
docker swarm leave


If you want to remove node completely
docker node ls

docker node rm node2


Now checkk node info master
docker node ls
